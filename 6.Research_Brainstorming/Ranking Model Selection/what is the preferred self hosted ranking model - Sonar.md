# what is the preferred self hosted ranking model for a self hosted milvus vector database for a self hosted all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a self-hosted GPT-NeoX Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Milvus as the vector database and the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model, the preferred self-hosted ranking model should balance cost and performance. Here are some considerations:

## **1. Vector Database: Milvus**

Milvus is an open-source vector database designed for high-performance similarity search, making it an excellent choice for SMEs due to its scalability and cost-effectiveness[^4][^6].

## **2. Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2**

This model is efficient for generating embeddings due to its relatively small size (10 million parameters) and ability to map sentences to dense vector spaces[^14][^20].

## **3. Ranking Model Options**

For a self-hosted RAG system with Milvus and all-MiniLM-L6-v2, consider the following ranking models:

- **BM25**: A widely used, lightweight ranking algorithm that can be integrated with vector databases. It is cost-effective and easy to implement[^3][^19].
- **Rerankers**: Specialized components that perform a second-stage evaluation of search results. They can enhance the performance of the RAG system by re-ranking candidates based on more sophisticated criteria[^1].
- **Fine-tuned GPT-NeoX**: If computational resources allow, fine-tuning GPT-NeoX to rank documents based on context relevance can provide high-quality results but may increase costs[^9].


### **Recommendation**

Given the need to minimize cost per use while maintaining performance, **BM25** is a preferred choice for its simplicity and effectiveness. For further optimization, integrating rerankers or fine-tuning GPT-NeoX can enhance performance but may require additional resources.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Setup Milvus**: Use Milvus as the vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
2. **Generate Embeddings**: Utilize the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to generate embeddings for documents and queries.
3. **Ranking with BM25**: Implement BM25 as the primary ranking model for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
4. **Optional: Reranking**: Consider integrating rerankers for a second-stage evaluation to improve result relevance.

This setup provides a balanced approach to cost and performance for SMEs.
