# what are the advantages of gpt-neox over llama-3 and other self hosted llms

---
GPT-NeoX is an open-source autoregressive language model with 20 billion parameters, offering several advantages over other self-hosted LLMs like Llama 3[^1][^2][^4][^7].

**Key Advantages of GPT-NeoX:**

* **Flexibility and Control** The open-source nature of GPT-NeoX allows for greater flexibility and control compared to proprietary models[^6].
* **Customization**: Developers can train GPT-NeoX on custom datasets, fine-tuning it for specific applications[^8].
* **Strong Community Support**: GPT-NeoX benefits from robust documentation and active forums, facilitating quicker solutions to technical challenges[^3].

**GPT-NeoX vs. Llama 3:**

* GPT-NeoX was created to provide an open-source alternative to GPT-3[^10][^13]. Llama 3 is also open source, but offers commercial licenses for those with fewer than 700 million monthly active users[^10].
* Llama 3 has been trained on 7x more data than Llama 2, and has improved alignment and output quality due to instruction-tuning data curation[^10].
* Llama is a family of LLMs that come in different sizes: 7, 13, 33, and 65 billion parameters[^11]. GPT-NeoX has 20 billion parameters[^1][^2].
* The GPT-NeoX models can be fine-tuned to perform a range of tasks like text generation, text classification, and sentiment analysis[^7].
* GPT-NeoX and GPT-J haven’t been trained with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)[^7][^18].

GPT-NeoX excels in understanding, generating, and processing natural language, making it suitable for tasks like language translation, summarization, and customer support[^5]. Its ability to understand context enables more accurate interpretation and decision-making[^5].
