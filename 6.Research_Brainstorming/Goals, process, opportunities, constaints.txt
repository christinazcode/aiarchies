Goals - 

- how to apply AI
- tools and catagories of the AI ecosystem
- AI architectural patterns and how to apply them
- limitations and risks associated with AI in architecture
- How AI impacts the structure of a system

- Fictional historical perspective
	- IT professions and architects must be licensed like doctors - SALB - Software Architecture Licensing board
	- Laws passed by serveral countries to match the US laws
	- Certifiable Inc - Market leaders - 
	- Product called - SoftArchCert
	
	- Expected increase in volume - 5-10x to certify and license architects
	= Apply Generative AI to assist with the manual processes to keep up with the demand
	- Identify opportunities to use AI and redesign the architecture to hande the surge in demand
	
Certification Process
- Two tests
	- Aptitude test
		- mutiple choice
		- short answer questions
		- answers stored in the database
		- multiple choice autograded
		- short answers are graded by expert software architects within 1 week of submission
		- score of 80% is a pass
		- candidates are notified why they did not pass, if they fail
		
	- architecture submission
		- case study
		- create an architecture
		- one of five case studies is randomly assigned for an architecture solution
		- two weeks to download and upload the arch solution
			- Distinct criteria used to grade the arch solution manually by the expert software architects within 1 week of submission
		= score of 80% is a pass
		- failure to score 80%, candidates can reapply for the arch submission portion of the test
	
	- certification info is saved in a verification database for candidates scoring 80% in both exams
	
Administrative Process
	- experts grade tests, but analyse reports and results to modify certification test questions
	- new tech patterns, practices are incorporated in the questions periodically
	- case studies are periodically added and replaced for the second portion of the test
	- Experts are contractors that work hourly. with varying demand
	- Administrator maintains the expert architect credentials in the system
	
- Company currently employees 300 experts. 5 of these are designated experts who can modify tests, earning $50 per hr.

- 200 candidates per week 
- expected to grow 5-10x with overseas expansion
- anticipated growth 21% over the next 4 years
- Licensing fee $800

- 3 hrs spent on the short answers review.
- 8 hrs spent on the architecure submission review by the experts

- Real stats
	- 176K software architects in the US
	- 300K job openings yet to be filled
	- 600K job openings in UK, Asia and Europe
	- 21% growth expected over the next 4 years
	
	- 120K software architects certified by Certifiable Inc. right now.
	
	- Candidate have 30 days from the first test to start their second test.
	- Certifiable has a 80% market share
	- Certifiable is willing to spend the money to incorporate AI solutions due to expected growth
	
Opportunities -
- By deploying an AI based solution - Reduce Experts intervention in improving and maintaining aptitude test questions.
= By deployig an AI based solution - Reduce experts intervention in updating the case studies options for the architecture submission part of the test. 
- Pre-screen short answers with the help of AI to reduce time spent by experts in the manual review. Currently 3 hours per test.
- Pre-screen architecture submissions with the help of AI to reduce time spent by experts in the manual review. Currently 8 hours per test.
- Reduce turn around time for test results - currently over 30 + 21 or 51 days combined for the two tests.

Constaints -
- The gross profit margin before infrastructure costs is $800 - $550 ($50 X 11 expert hrs) = $250.
- The growth projections and the additional AI system costs must improve the profit margin not reduce it.
- Maintain data security by securely saving all data on corporate managed, isolated systems (not exposed to public cloud infrastructure).
