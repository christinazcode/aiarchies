# How does Langsmith handle team collaboration compared to Langfuse

---
Both LangSmith and Langfuse offer features to enhance team collaboration in LLM application development, but they approach it in slightly different ways:

## Organizational Structure

### LangSmith

LangSmith recently introduced a new organizational structure:

- Organizations are top-level entities that contain projects[^2].
- Workspaces provide logical grouping of users and resources within an organization[^1].
- Users can be assigned roles at both the organization and workspace levels[^2].


### Langfuse

Langfuse also uses an organizational structure:

- Organizations are top-level entities containing projects[^11].
- Projects can be grouped into a single organization[^11].
- Users can be assigned roles at both the organization and project levels[^6].


## Access Control

### LangSmith

- Offers Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with custom roles and granular permissions[^3].
- Supports organization-scoped roles and workspace-specific roles[^1].
- Provides built-in system roles: Admin, Viewer, and Editor[^3].


### Langfuse

- Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with customizable roles[^6].
- Offers roles like Owner, Admin, Member, and Viewer[^6].
- Allows project-level role assignments for more fine-grained control[^6].


## Collaboration Features

### LangSmith

- Enables sharing and collaboration on prompts within the team[^8].
- Offers version control for prompts, allowing teams to track changes over time[^8].
- Provides advanced search and filtering options for prompts[^8].


### Langfuse

- Supports collaborative prompt management and versioning[^10].
- Allows teams to iterate on prompts directly from the Langfuse UI[^10].
- Enables promotion of prompts to production for easy integration in applications[^10].


## Environment Management

### LangSmith

- Uses workspaces to separate resources between different teams, business units, or deployment environments[^1].


### Langfuse

- Offers two options for managing different environments:

1. Separate projects for each environment (production, staging, development)[^12].
2. Tags for consolidated view across environments[^12].


## Integration and Ecosystem

### LangSmith

- Seamlessly integrates with LangChain's open-source frameworks[^15].
- Part of a broader ecosystem including tools like LangSmith for debugging and monitoring[^13].


### Langfuse

- Provides SDKs and APIs for custom integrations[^4].
- Offers framework-agnostic support, working with various LLM libraries[^4].

In conclusion, while both platforms offer robust collaboration features, LangSmith's tight integration with the LangChain ecosystem may be advantageous for teams heavily invested in LangChain. Langfuse, on the other hand, provides more flexibility in terms of framework support and self-hosting options, which could be beneficial for teams with diverse tech stacks or specific deployment requirements.
