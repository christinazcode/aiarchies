# Assumptions and Constraints

## Assumptions
 
**ROI**: By reducing the grading hours per candidate from 11 hours to 2 hours or less, the existing variable cost of grading is reduced from $550 to $100. The new variable cost will include LLM usage and fixed costs for the additional infrastructure required for the solution.

Impact on **headcounts**: There are no significant changes to the current full-time headcount and the 300 consultants. The productivity gain from the solution will effectively scale the business to handle projected growth.

**Rolling deployment**: The solution will be rolled out stage by stage to ensure users are able to take full advantage of the system and are fully aware of the risks and limitations.

**Workflow** modification: The new workflow will be defined and evolve as the solution rolls out.

Solution **adaptation**: The current workforce needs to be trained on the new workflow and upskilled in prompt engineering.

## Constraints

**English as the primary language**: The existing system and the solution will only support English, despite international expansion. This is reasonable given that existing and future architects are working in a global market; English is the dominant language for global business interactions, and 17% of the world's population speaks English.  While it is desirable for some smaller, niche companies to provide certification in other languages in the future to support diverse talent, this solution will initially focus on English.
