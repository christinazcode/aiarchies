# Functional Requirements

The **Augmenting Human Intelligence solution** makes it more efficient for both full-time and part-time expert software architects to collaborate.

The agent, named **Ema**, enables authorized users to have certifiable, context-aware conversations to assist with their tasks.

The five designated experts can use the solution to **brainstorm** ideas to modify certification tests and change/add case studies. They can continue the conversation with Ema to further fine-tune those ideas.

Ungraded aptitude tests and architecture submissions will be scanned automatically to check for **plagiarism**, including internet searches, previous aptitude tests and submissions, and AI-generated content.

The solution will **summarize** any test answers longer than 50 words and generate feedback so the expert software architects can spend two hours or less grading each candidate.

The solution will provide **references** to previous submissions and feedback for the same or similar questions to help maintain consistency and fairness in the grading process.

Users can **rank** LLM responses to improve the LLM's response generation, including Ema's.
