## Introduction
The objective of the exercise is to learn the applicability of AI technologies to enhance existing system solutions.

## Kata Goals

- Analyse the existing system's architecture to **identify manual steps and likely bottlenecks** 
- Determine how GenAI could address **the growth in demand and potential scalability problems** 
- Select opportunities for adding AI to the existing system and **how** it can be applied
- **Redesign the existing** architecture to support these changes
  
### Judging criteria

1. Innovative use of GenAI
2. Suitability of solution given the constraints
3. Provide an appropriate level of details
4. Use of AI architecture patterns and avoidance of AI architecture anti-patterns 
5. Match the current solution's architectural characteristics (a.k.a qualities, non-functional requirements) in the AI additions

## Company Overview and Requirements Context

### Architect license process
1. Test 1: The aptitude test is grated by auto for multiple choice and experts for passing 80%, if they fail then Why is communicated
2. Test 2: After the successful first step, a Case study is assigned and the candidate uploads the solution, using a set of criteria experts grade, passing at 80%
### Admin process
- Experts analyze aptitude reports and results to modify tests like
	- Add or change the questions or answers
	- Add and remove the test case studies
- Experts are contractors who maintain aptitude tests and case studies
- Certification Admin maintains users
- There is a UI to View certification results
- 300 experts but only 5 are designated to make test changes
- 200 candidates go through the process each week
- Exam cost $800 [registrations and payments are inconsequential details and excluded from the consideration]
- There are 120K certified architects; TAM ~ 176K are certified + 300K uncertified 
- 1 week for Test 1 and within 30 days 1 week for Test 2

## Requirements

- The company wants to see how generative AI could be used to help with anticipated growth of 5-10 times due to EU market expansion and 21% due to YoY growth

## Deliverables: 
- AI perspective of the solution: how the team used AI, what data and UIs are required to implement the certification solution 
- More details in the diagrams
- ADRs of AI implementation; including trade-off analysis and consequences
- [optional] pertinent implementation details
- [semi-finalists] five minutes videos describing

### Important use cases visualized on sequence diagrams
