## Introduction
The objective of the exercise is to learn the applicability of AI technologies to enhance existing system solutions.

## Kata Goals

- Analyse the existing system's architecture to **identify manual steps and likely bottlenecks** 
- Determine how GenAI could address **the growth in demand and potential scalability problems** 
- Select opportunities for adding AI to the existing system and **how** it can be applied
- **Redesign the existing** architecture to support these changes
  
### Judging criteria

1. Innovative use of GenAI
2. Suitability of solution given the constraints
3. Provide an appropriate level of details
4. Use of AI architecture patterns and avoidance of AI architecture anti-patterns 
5. Match the current solution's architectural characteristics (a.k.a qualities, non-functional requirements) in the AI additions

## Deliverables: 
- AI perspective of the solution: how the team used AI, what data and UIs are required to implement the certification solution 
- More details in the diagrams
- ADRs of AI implementation; including trade-off analysis and consequences
- [optional] pertinent implementation details
- [semi-finalists] five minutes videos describing

### Important use cases visualized on sequence diagrams

## Deployment

## Fitness functions

## Constraints Known issues

## Observability
