# aiarchies
Project Deliverables: 
	• AI perspective of the solution: how team used AI, what data and UIs are required to implement the cert solution 
	• More details in diagrams
	• ADRs of AI implementation; including trade-off analysis and consequences
	• [optional] pertinent implementation details
	• [semi-finalists] five minutes videos describing

Judging criteria
	1. Innovative use of GenAI
	2. Suitability of solution given the constraints
	3. Provide appropriate level of details
	4. Use of AI architecture patterns and avoidance of AI architecture anti-patterns 
	5. Match the solution's architectural characteristics in additions
