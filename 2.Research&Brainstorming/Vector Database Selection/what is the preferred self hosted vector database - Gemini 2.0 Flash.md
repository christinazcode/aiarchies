# what is the preferred self hosted vector database for a self hosted embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a small or medium enterprise (SME) aiming to minimize cost per use in a self-hosted GPT-NeoX RAG system, several open-source vector databases stand out[^1][^2][^5][^6][^9]. These options provide a balance of performance and cost-effectiveness.

Here are the recommended choices:

1. **Milvus**:
    * **Strengths**: Designed for AI applications and similarity searches[^1]. It is a powerful open-source vector database[^1].
    * **Cost Efficiency**: It's free to use and self-host, which reduces operational costs[^1][^2].
2. **Weaviate**:
    * **Strengths**: Combines vector search with structured filtering, allowing complex queries[^2]. It is cloud-native and open-source[^11].
    * **Cost Efficiency**: Open-source and self-hostable, thereby minimizing costs[^2].
3. **Qdrant**:
    * **Strengths**: Written in Rust, it is a fast and scalable vector similarity search service. Supports advanced filtering and payload management[^2][^14].
    * **Cost Efficiency**: As a free and open-source solution, it reduces operational expenses[^2].
4. **PostgreSQL with pgvector**:
    * **Strengths**: It leverages the robustness of PostgreSQL and adds vector capabilities[^4].
    * **Cost Efficiency**: It is free to use and integrates well with existing PostgreSQL infrastructure[^4].

When evaluating open-source vector databases, it's important to consider the hardware costs associated with running them[^10]. Setting up a distributed database like Milvus involves WAL deployment, secure metadata storage, and orchestration with Kubernetes, which can impact the hardware budget, especially for smaller projects[^10]. Performance tests are crucial to understanding how the database handles real-life workloads[^10].

Ultimately, the decision should be based on a clear comparison of the costs involved in handling specific data volumes and query rates to determine the most cost-effective option[^10]. Using dynamic scaling can help avoid paying for unused resources, but it's important to balance this with the potential for under-provisioning[^10].

Considering these factors, Milvus, Weaviate, Qdrant, and PostgreSQL with pgvector are excellent choices for SMEs looking to minimize costs in a self-hosted GPT-NeoX RAG system[^2][^5][^9].
