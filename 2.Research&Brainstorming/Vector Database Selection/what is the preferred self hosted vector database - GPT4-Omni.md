# what is the preferred self hosted vector database for a self hosted embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a self-hosted GPT-NeoX RAG system in a small or medium enterprise (SME) where cost per use is prioritized over performance, the following open-source vector databases are the most suitable options:

## Recommended Self-Hosted Vector Databases

1. **Milvus**
    - **Strengths**: Milvus is a highly scalable and efficient vector database designed for AI applications. It supports various indexing methods (e.g., IVF, HNSW) and integrates well with Kubernetes for distributed deployments.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: While free to use, hosting Milvus requires infrastructure like etcd, Kafka, and Kubernetes, which may increase initial setup complexity and cost for smaller projects[^1][^5][^10].
    - **Best Use Case**: Large-scale RAG systems with high query volumes or future scalability needs.
2. **Qdrant**
    - **Strengths**: Qdrant is written in Rust, offering fast vector similarity search and advanced filtering capabilities. It is lightweight and easy to deploy compared to Milvus.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Minimal resource requirements make it highly cost-effective for SMEs with tight budgets[^2][^5][^14].
    - **Best Use Case**: Real-time applications or SMEs requiring fast performance without significant infrastructure overhead.
3. **Weaviate**
    - **Strengths**: Weaviate supports hybrid queries (structured + vector search) and offers a user-friendly GraphQL interface. It also includes built-in modules for text and image embeddings.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Open-source and self-hostable, but its cloud-native design may require additional resources for optimal performance[^2][^9][^11].
    - **Best Use Case**: Applications needing hybrid search capabilities or integration with structured data.
4. **PostgreSQL with pgvector Extension**
    - **Strengths**: PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension enables vector search within a relational database. It is simple to set up and manage, leveraging existing PostgreSQL infrastructure.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Extremely cost-efficient for small-scale deployments or SMEs already using PostgreSQL[^6][^7].
    - **Best Use Case**: Small-scale RAG systems or those combining vector search with relational data.

## Cost Optimization Tips

- Use lightweight models like Qdrant or PostgreSQL for minimal infrastructure costs.
- Leverage dynamic scaling to allocate resources only when needed.
- Optimize index types (e.g., IVF_Flat for high accuracy or HNSW for low latency) based on your application's recall/latency trade-offs[^10].


## Recommendation

For SMEs prioritizing cost-efficiency:

- Start with **Qdrant** if you need fast, real-time performance with minimal setup complexity.
- Use **PostgreSQL with pgvector** if your dataset is small and you already have PostgreSQL expertise or infrastructure.
- Choose **Milvus** if scalability is a long-term priority but be prepared for higher initial hosting complexity.

These solutions balance cost savings with sufficient performance for most SME RAG applications.
