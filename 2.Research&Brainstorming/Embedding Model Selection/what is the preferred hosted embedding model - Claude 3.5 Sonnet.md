# what is the preferred hosted embedding model for a hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise

---
For small to medium enterprises implementing a hosted GPT-NeoX RAG system, the most practical and cost-effective embedding model choices as of early 2025 are:

## Primary Recommendations

**OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small** is currently the best choice for most small/medium enterprises because it offers:

- Excellent performance-to-cost ratio
- Simple API integration
- Managed infrastructure
- Predictable pricing

**Cohere Embed v3** serves as a strong alternative, providing:

- Competitive performance
- Simple hosted solution
- Flexible pricing options
- Good documentation and support


## Open Source Alternative

If you prefer to avoid dependency on commercial APIs, **BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5** offers:

- Strong performance for its size
- No usage fees
- Lower computational requirements
- Easy self-hosting capabilities

The choice between these options primarily depends on your:

- Monthly query volume
- Latency requirements
- Infrastructure capabilities
- Budget constraints

For most small/medium enterprises, starting with OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small provides the best balance of performance, cost, and operational simplicity while maintaining the option to switch providers as needs evolve.
