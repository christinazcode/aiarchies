# langfuse vs. langsmith

---
Langfuse and LangSmith are both powerful platforms for LLM observability, evaluation, and prompt management, but they have some key differences:

## Open Source vs. Closed Source

Langfuse is open-source, allowing for customization and self-hosting[^1][^5]. LangSmith is a closed-source product developed by the LangChain team[^8].

## Integration and Compatibility

LangSmith integrates seamlessly with LangChain and is the preferred choice for developers heavily invested in the LangChain ecosystem[^7]. Langfuse offers broader integration capabilities, working with various LLM frameworks and libraries beyond LangChain[^7].

## Evaluation Capabilities

LangSmith provides built-in, automated evaluation tools, making it easier to define metrics, score outputs, and conduct A/B testing[^7]. Langfuse allows for more manual control over evaluation logic but requires custom implementation[^7].

## Self-Hosting and Data Privacy

Langfuse can be self-hosted for free, making it an attractive option for teams with strict data privacy requirements[^5][^8]. LangSmith requires a paid enterprise license for self-hosting[^8].

## Pricing and Accessibility

Langfuse offers a free tier for observability and a more affordable starting price for its pro plan[^2][^13]. LangSmith's pricing structure is less transparent, with enterprise plans starting at higher price points[^13].

## User Interface and Ease of Use

Some users report that LangSmith's dashboard can be confusing and requires significant configuration[^13]. Langfuse's interface is generally considered more intuitive, although some users find its dashboard confusing as well[^13].

## Community and Support

As an open-source project, Langfuse benefits from community contributions and support[^5]. LangSmith, being developed by the LangChain team, may offer more specialized support for LangChain users.

## Performance and Scalability

Both platforms offer robust performance monitoring capabilities. Langfuse's self-hosted option allows for more control over infrastructure and potential cost savings at scale[^7].

In conclusion, the choice between Langfuse and LangSmith depends on your specific needs. If you're deeply invested in the LangChain ecosystem and prefer a fully managed solution with built-in evaluation tools, LangSmith might be the better choice. If you prioritize open-source flexibility, broader framework support, and data privacy through self-hosting, Langfuse could be more suitable.
