# what is the preferred self hosted ranking model for a self hosted milvus vector database for a self hosted all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a self-hosted RAG system using Milvus as the vector database, the **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model for embeddings, and GPT-NeoX as the generator, the preferred ranking model should balance cost-efficiency and performance. Based on the system's requirements and Milvus's capabilities, the following recommendations apply:

## **Preferred Self-Hosted Ranking Model**

### **1. Cross-Encoders (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`)**

- **Why Choose It?**
    - Cross-encoders are highly effective for reranking because they evaluate query-document pairs directly, considering semantic relationships in detail.
    - The `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` cross-encoder is lightweight and aligns well with the embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), ensuring consistency in representation.
    - Open-source availability makes it cost-effective for SMEs.
- **Integration with Milvus**: Milvus supports cross-encoders natively, making implementation seamless[^4][^9].


### **2. BM25**

- **Why Choose It?**
    - BM25 is a probabilistic ranking model that works well when combined with vector-based retrieval, especially for sparse or keyword-based queries.
    - It is computationally inexpensive and can complement dense vector searches by adding keyword relevance to the ranking process.
- **Integration with Milvus**: BM25 is supported as part of hybrid search capabilities in Milvus, enabling a mix of sparse and dense retrieval for improved accuracy[^2][^7].


### **3. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**

- **Why Choose It?**
    - RRF combines rankings from multiple retrieval methods (e.g., dense vectors and sparse keywords) without requiring explicit weighting.
    - It is particularly useful when there is no clear precedence among ranking factors, making it versatile for diverse datasets.
- **Integration with Milvus**: RRF is supported in Milvus through its reranking strategies, allowing easy implementation[^1].


### **4. Weighted Ranker**

- **Why Choose It?**
    - The Weighted Ranker assigns importance to different retrieval routes (e.g., text embeddings vs. metadata) based on predefined weights.
    - This approach is ideal for SMEs where certain data sources might be more reliable or relevant than others.
- **Integration with Milvus**: Directly supported by Milvus's reranking framework, allowing fine-grained control over ranking priorities[^1].


## **Recommendation Summary**

For a cost-conscious SME:

1. Use **Cross-Encoders** like `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` for high-quality semantic reranking.
2. Combine with **BM25** or **RRF** for hybrid search scenarios where both dense and sparse features matter.
3. Consider the **Weighted Ranker** if specific data sources require prioritization.

These models are natively supported or easily integrated with Milvus, ensuring minimal engineering overhead while optimizing performance and cost-efficiency[^1][^4][^9].
