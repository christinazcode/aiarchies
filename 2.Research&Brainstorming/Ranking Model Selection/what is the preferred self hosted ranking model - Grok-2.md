# what is the preferred self hosted ranking model for a self hosted milvus vector database for a self hosted all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a self-hosted Milvus vector database integrated with a self-hosted all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model in a GPT-NeoX RAG system for a small or medium enterprise (SME) aiming to minimize costs while maintaining performance, the preferred ranking model would be **BM25** (via Elasticsearch). Here's why:

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: BM25 is a lightweight and effective ranking method that can be integrated with Milvus or other vector databases like Qdrant. It does not require the computational resources of more complex models, making it cost-effective for SMEs[^2][^5].
- **Performance**: BM25 provides a good balance between performance and simplicity. It can efficiently rerank documents based on keyword matching, which complements the semantic search capabilities of vector databases[^5].
- **Integration**: BM25 can be easily integrated into existing search pipelines, especially when using Elasticsearch, which is often used alongside vector databases for hybrid search capabilities[^5].

While fine-tuning a model like GPT-NeoX for ranking could potentially yield better results, it would significantly increase computational costs and complexity, which might not align with the cost minimization goal for SMEs. Therefore, BM25 stands out as the preferred choice for this specific setup.
