## Architecture Principles
A few core architecture principles to make sure that our architecture and system design align with strategic business objectives and existing systems' qualities.  [Placeholder]

| Principle              | Description                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Buy vs Build | Prefer to reuse an existing functionality if it provides necessary support to address business needs
| Separation of Concerns | Divide the components of the system into specific features so that there is no overlapping among the components' functionality. This will provide high cohesion and low coupling. This approach avoids the interdependency among components of the system which helps in maintaining the system easy.
