## Title: 

003: LLM Technology

## Status: 

Proposed

## Context:

- The recommendation system needs LLM model for baseline processing
- Requirements considerations are cost, reliability, accuracy, and performance
- Select something that works with Sage Maker used for hosting of our RAG system.

## Decision:

- We will use GTP NeoX tool for self hosted LLM capabilitie.

The primary concern is minimizing costs and we have the technical capability to handle setup and maintenance, GPT-NeoX is a strong choice.
 
## Consequences:

- Product ownership and cost.
- Implementation installation, configuration, and integration.
- Run time process flow and connectivity.
- Maintainability and tuning
