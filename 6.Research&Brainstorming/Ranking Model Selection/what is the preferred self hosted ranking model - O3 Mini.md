# what is the preferred self hosted ranking model for a self hosted milvus vector database for a self hosted all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a self-hosted RAG system using Milvus as the vector database, the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model, and GPT-NeoX, the preferred self-hosted ranking model should balance cost-efficiency and performance. Based on the requirements, here are the best options:

### **1. Cross-Encoders (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`)**

- **Why:** Cross-encoders like `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` are highly effective for reranking tasks. They evaluate the relevance of each document to the query by jointly encoding them, providing high accuracy.
- **Cost:** These models are open-source and can run on CPUs or GPUs, making them cost-effective for SMEs with moderate computational resources.
- **Integration with Milvus:** Milvus supports cross-encoder models natively through PyMilvus, allowing seamless integration into your RAG pipeline[^1][^3].


### **2. BGE Rerankers (e.g., `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`)**

- **Why:** BGE rerankers are optimized for reranking tasks and are supported by Milvus. They are lightweight and can run efficiently on standard hardware.
- **Cost:** Open-source and resource-efficient, making them ideal for minimizing operational costs.
- **Integration with Milvus:** Directly supported by PyMilvus, simplifying deployment and use[^1][^2].


### **3. BM25 (Sparse Retrieval)**

- **Why:** BM25 is a traditional sparse retrieval model that is computationally inexpensive and effective for initial ranking or as a fallback method in hybrid search setups.
- **Cost:** Extremely low-cost since it relies on simple term frequency-based calculations.
- **Integration with Milvus:** BM25 is supported as part of Milvus's hybrid search capabilities, enabling a mix of sparse and dense retrieval[^2][^3].


### **Recommended Setup**

1. Use Milvus for efficient vector search with embeddings generated by `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
2. Employ a two-stage ranking process:
    - **Initial Retrieval:** Use Milvus's vector similarity search to retrieve candidate documents.
    - **Reranking:** Use a cross-encoder like `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` or BGE reranker (`BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`) for final ranking based on relevance.

This setup ensures high-quality results while keeping costs manageable, leveraging open-source tools and efficient computation.
