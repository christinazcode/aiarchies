# what is the preferred self hosted ranking model for a self hosted milvus vector database for a self hosted all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a self-hosted RAG system using Milvus and All-MiniLM-L6-v2, the recommended ranking approach is to implement a two-stage retrieval and reranking process to optimize both cost and performance.

## Primary Ranking Components

### Vector Search Stage

Milvus provides built-in vector similarity search which serves as the first-stage retrieval mechanism[^1]. This initial ranking uses the 384-dimensional dense vectors generated by All-MiniLM-L6-v2[^10] to find relevant candidates.

### Reranking Stage

For cost-effective reranking in Milvus:

- Use Milvus's native reranking capabilities which are designed for efficient second-stage evaluation of search results[^4][^9].
- Implement a lightweight BM25-style scoring mechanism for text-based reranking, which provides good performance with minimal computational overhead.


## Integration Strategy

Milvus offers direct integration with embedding models and reranking systems through PyMilvus[^9], making it straightforward to:

- Store and index vectors from All-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Apply multi-stage ranking for improved accuracy
- Scale the system based on enterprise needs[^11]

This setup provides an optimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance for SMEs, leveraging Milvus's built-in features rather than requiring additional resource-intensive ranking models.
