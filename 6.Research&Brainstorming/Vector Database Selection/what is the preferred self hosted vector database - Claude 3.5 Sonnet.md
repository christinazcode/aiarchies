# what is the preferred self hosted vector database for a self hosted embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For small and medium enterprises looking to minimize costs while maintaining good performance in a self-hosted GPT-NeoX RAG system, several open-source vector databases stand out as of early 2025:

## Top Recommendations

1. **Milvus**:
    - Offers powerful similarity search capabilities[^1][^2]
    - Provides consistent user experience and scalability
    - Suitable for AI applications and production environments[^10]
2. **Weaviate**:
    - Cloud-native and resilient[^11]
    - Written in Go with good performance characteristics[^5]
    - Offers both vector and traditional search capabilities
3. **Qdrant**:
    - Written in Rust for optimal performance[^14]
    - Provides fast and scalable vector similarity search
    - Strong community support and active development

## Cost Considerations

When implementing these databases, consider these cost factors:

- Hardware requirements for database dependencies (WAL deployment, metadata storage)[^10]
- Storage solutions and networking costs
- Engineering time for setup and maintenance
- Performance vs. resource usage trade-offs


## Recommendation

For most SMEs, **Qdrant** emerges as the preferred choice due to its:

- Lower resource requirements
- Efficient Rust implementation
- Straightforward setup process
- Good balance of performance and cost-effectiveness[^2]

If scaling is a primary concern, **Milvus** would be the better alternative, though it requires more initial setup and resources[^9].
