# what is the preferred self hosted vector database for a self hosted embedding model for a self hosted gpt-neox rag system for a small or medium enterprise where cost per use is to be minimized compared to performance

---
For a self-hosted GPT-NeoX RAG system in a small or medium enterprise where cost per use needs to be minimized while maintaining performance, the preferred self-hosted vector databases are open-source solutions. These databases offer scalability, flexibility, and strong community support without recurring costs. Here are some top choices:

## Recommended Open-Source Vector Databases

1. **Milvus**:
    - **Strengths**: Scalable, high-performance similarity search engine. It supports various indexing methods and integrates well with AI frameworks.
    - **Use Case**: Suitable for large-scale RAG systems requiring efficient vector similarity searches.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Free to self-host, reducing operational costs.
    - **Performance**: Excellent for handling high-dimensional data.
2. **Weaviate**:
    - **Strengths**: Offers hybrid search capabilities, combining vector and structured data queries. It is scalable and production-ready.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications requiring both vector and structured data queries.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Open-source and self-hostable, minimizing costs.
    - **Performance**: Strong recall rates and flexible data vectorization.
3. **Qdrant**:
    - **Strengths**: Fast and scalable vector similarity search service. It supports filtering and hybrid search, making it versatile for various use cases.
    - **Use Case**: Suitable for real-time applications requiring fast vector searches.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Free to self-host, though cloud services incur costs.
    - **Performance**: High recall rates and customizable distance metrics.
4. **PostgreSQL with pgvector**:
    - **Strengths**: Leverages PostgreSQL's robustness and adds vector capabilities. It is cost-effective for smaller datasets.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for smaller-scale applications or those already using PostgreSQL.
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Free to use and integrates well with existing PostgreSQL infrastructure.
    - **Performance**: Good for smaller datasets but may not scale as well as dedicated vector databases.

## Considerations

- **Scalability**: Milvus and Weaviate are highly scalable, making them suitable for growing datasets.
- **Ease of Use**: Weaviate offers a user-friendly GraphQL interface, while Qdrant provides a simple REST API.
- **Community Support**: All three have active communities, ensuring regular updates and support.


## Recommendation

For a self-hosted GPT-NeoX RAG system in an SME, **Milvus** or **Weaviate** are strong choices due to their scalability and performance. If you prefer a simpler setup with existing PostgreSQL infrastructure, **PostgreSQL with pgvector** is a cost-effective option. **Qdrant** is ideal for applications requiring fast real-time vector searches. Always evaluate these options based on your specific use case and performance requirements.

### Example Use Case

If your SME is building a RAG system for document retrieval, Milvus might be the best choice due to its high scalability and efficient similarity searches. For applications requiring both vector and structured queries, Weaviate's hybrid search capabilities make it an excellent option.
